            </ul>

            <h3>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
            <p>We retain your personal information only as long as needed for the purposes in this notice or as required

                law. When no longer needed, we securely delete or anonymize it.</p>

            <h3>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
            <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures to protect
                your
                personal information. However, no internet transmission or storage technology can be guaranteed 100%
                secure.
                While we strive to protect your data, transmitting personal information through our Services is at your
                own
                risk. Please access the Services only in a secure environment.</p>

            <h3>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
            <p>Depending on your location—such as the US, EEA, UK, Switzerland, or Canada—you have rights to access,
                update,
                or delete your data, restrict processing, and object to automated decisions. You can contact us to
                exercise
                these rights. If you believe your data is processed unlawfully in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, you may
                also
                file a complaint with the relevant data protection authority.</p>
            <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we process your personal information based on your consent,
                you
                have the right to withdraw that consent at any time by contacting us. Withdrawing consent won't affect
                the
                legality of any prior processing under other lawful grounds. For questions or concerns about your
                privacy
                rights, you can email us at official@safewox.com.</p>

            <h3>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
            <p>Many browsers and devices offer a Do-Not-Track (DNT) feature to signal your preference not to be tracked
                online. However, because no uniform standard exists, we do not respond to DNT signals or similar
                automatic
                requests.</p>

            <h3>9. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>

                or
                Virginia, you may have rights to access, correct, obtain, or delete your personal information. You may
                also
                withdraw your consent to our processing. These rights may be limited by law. More details are provided
                below.</p>
            <p><strong>Will your information be shared with anyone else?</strong></p>
            <p>We share your personal information with service providers under contracts to support our services. We may
                also use your information internally for research and development, which isn't considered selling.</p>
            <p><strong>Your Rights</strong></p>
            <p>You have rights under certain US state data protection laws. However, these rights are not absolute, and
                in
                certain cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law. These rights include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have the right to know if we process your data, access it, correct errors, request deletion, and
                    obtain copies of data you shared.</li>

                <li>You can opt out of targeted advertising or profiling that leads to significant legal effects.</li>
                <li>Depending on your state, you may also have rights to:

                        <li>Option out of data collection via voice or facial recognition.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to Exercise Your Rights</strong></p>
            <p>You can exercise your rights by submitting a data subject access request, emailing official@safewox.com.
                In
                some US states, you may appoint an authorized agent to act for you, but we may deny requests if the
                agent
                doesn't provide valid proof of authorization as required by law.</p>
            <p><strong>Request Verification</strong></p>
            <p>When we receive your request, we'll verify your identity using the personal information you provide. If
                needed, we may ask for more details to confirm your identity and prevent fraud. If an authorized agent
                submits the request, they must provide written, signed permission from you.</p>
            <p><strong>Appeals</strong></p>
            <p>Under certain US state data protection laws, if we decline your request, you have the right to appeal by
                emailing us at official@safewox.com. We will respond in writing with the outcome and reasons for our
                decision. If your appeal is denied, you may file a complaint with your state attorney general.</p>
            <p><strong>California 'Shine The Light' Law</strong></p>
            <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, or the 'Shine The Light' law, lets California residents request,
                once
                a year for free, details about any personal information we shared with third parties for direct
                marketing in
                the past year, including the names and addresses of those third parties.</p>
